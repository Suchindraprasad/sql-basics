---- IS NULL | IS NOT NULL

SELECT * FROM payment2 WHERE customer_id IS NULL;
UPDATE payment2 SET customer_id = NULL WHERE customer_id = 107;

SELECT * FROM payment2 WHERE customer_id = NULL; --- will not work
SELECT * FROM payment2 WHERE customer_id IS NULL; -- this is how you should use condition to filter NULL values
